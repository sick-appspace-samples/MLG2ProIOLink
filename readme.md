## MLG2ProIOLink
Connecting and communicating to IO-Link device MLG-2 Pro automation lightgrid
### Description
This sample shows how to connect to the IO-Link device MLG-2 Pro and how to
receive measurement data.
### How to Run
This sample can be run on any AppSpace device which can act as an IO-Link master,
e.g. SIM family. The IO-Link device MLG-2 Pro must be properly connected to a port
which supports IO-Link. If the port is configured as IO-Link master, see script,
the power LED blinks slowly. When a IO-Link device is successfully connected the
LED blinks rapidly.
### More Information
See device manual of IO-Link master for according ports. See manual of IO-Link
device MLG-2 Pro for further IO-Link specific description and device specific commands
